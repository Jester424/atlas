# Atlas

Atlas is a web application that maps cultural–contextual familiarity across media.

Users respond to agreement-scale statements such as:
> “I expect people in my age group to be familiar with this piece of media.”

These responses are aggregated into a **Cultural–Contextual Familiarity (CCF) score** associated with each item.  
Media can then be browsed and sorted based on their CCF score.

Atlas is not intended to evaluate the quality or merit of media.  
Instead, it aims to answer questions such as:
> “How likely is it that this piece of media will be referenced or assumed familiar in casual conversation?”

The initial implementation focuses on films, with plans to expand to additional forms of media over time.

## Status

This project is in early development. The current focus is on establishing the core data model and scoring methodology.
